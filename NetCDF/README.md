# NetCDF Command line
The docs are on the `NetCDF_CommandLine.txt`. The `NetCDF_Summary.txt` gives you a summary of what is a NetCDF file.


# NetCDF Python
The file `geoeoas.yml` is used to create the conda environment. We need to clean the packages because not all of them are used for this example.
Install it with:

`
conda env create -f geoeoas.yml
`

## Run
Just run the example with `python io_xarray.py`.
